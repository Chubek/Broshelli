# Broshelli: A Terminal Emulator for your Browser

Broshelli is a terminal emulator for your browser.

It is meant for WebAssembly. Although if it does not work as intended, I will make it a browser extension.

**HIGHLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Just take a look, don't compile it. Because it WON'T. I am currently fixing a lot of syntactic issues. Also I need to make it X-Compliant.

Please tell me the mistakes I have made so far. I will post this on the fora and also I am reachable on Discord under `.chubak`.

Thanks

UPDATE: `clang-tidy` says no errors?
